## Data Set  
The dataset utilized in this analysis is sourced from Kaggle, offering comprehensive information about Netflix's content library. This dataset provides detailed information about Netflix's extensive library, encompassing both movies and TV shows. It includes unique identifiers for each title, the type of content (movie or TV show), titles, directors, cast members, production countries, the date content was added to Netflix, release years, and TV ratings.

## Problem Statement 
This analysis seeks to decode Netflix's content strategy by examining the relationship between key variables‚Äîincluding content format (movies vs. series), language localization, release timing (seasonal/quarterly), and production attributes‚Äîand their collective impact on viewership performance.

#### Core Objectives:
- Performance Benchmarking
- Identify high-engagement content traits (genres, languages, formats)
- Quantify the ROI of localization strategies

#### Temporal Analysis
- Map release cadence to viewership spikes
- Determine optimal launch windows for different content types

#### Strategic Insights
- Reverse-engineer Netflix's data-driven content decisions
- Surface actionable opportunities for inventory optimization

#### Business Impact:
The findings will empower content strategists to:
- Allocate production budgets more effectively
- Tailor regional catalogs based on proven performance drivers
- Anticipate engagement patterns through temporal analytics

## Data Preparation and Data Quality Checks
The dataset contained 24,812 records with significant quality issues requiring remediation: 67% missing release dates (16,646 nulls) and improperly formatted "Hours Viewed" values (e.g., "81,21,00,000"). Key preparation steps included converting string-based viewership metrics to numeric values, standardizing datetime formats for release dates, and filtering to 2023 content (yielding 786 analyzable records). Temporal features (seasons/quarters) were engineered, and categorical variables were validated-Language Indicator (6 unique values) and Content Type (2 values) showed complete data integrity. The cleaned dataset now supports robust analysis of 2023 viewing patterns across content types, languages, and release timing, with all numerical and temporal fields standardized for analytical operations.
